Airbnb Clone Project
This project is an Airbnb clone, a vacation rental platform that allows users to list, discover, and book accommodations around the world.
The goal is to replicate key features of the Airbnb platform, providing a similar experience.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to interact with the Airbnb clone system.
It provides a set of commands to manage listings, bookings, users, and other functionalities.
The command interpreter is built to streamline the development process and facilitate testing.

How to Use and use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use various commands to interact with the Airbnb clone system.
Here are some essential commands:
create <object>: Create a new object (e.g., listing, user).
show <object_id>: Display details of a specific object.
update <object_id> <attribute> <value>: Update the attributes of an object.
destroy <object_id>: Delete an object.

Examples
Create a new listing:
create Listing city="Accra" price=150.
Show details of a user:
show User 123
Update the description of a listing:
update Listing 456 description="Rhybak apartment in the heart of Accra"
Delete a booking:
